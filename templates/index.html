   In the world of computer science, there are many approaches to extracting emotion from a voice recording, as well as many use  cases for it. Each approach has its own feature set to help guide it. Emotion Detection helps us in more than one way such as animating virtual reality characters, getting honest feedback on educational, medical, and economical practice. The aim of the research detailed below is to use deep learning in a new way, with a new number of features in order to extract the feelings represented in an audio recording. There are many variables coming into play here, like the type of the database of shows, there are 2 main types, acts (also known as fully blown) and real databases. In this case, we will be using an acted database as it is easier to gather the data for. There are also the languages to be chosen for the testing we will be doing. As we are trying to disconnect the language from the emotion being portrayed in the clips shown, it is preferable to use languages unknown to the researcher or the interviewees. Another thing to note is the type of emotion recognition. It can be broad (positive or negative), or specific (happy, surprised, angry, sad). In order to improve upon previous papers, we have chosen the more detailed option. <a href="/chooseModel">Get Started</a>
